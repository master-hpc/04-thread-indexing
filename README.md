# "Thread Indexing"
> Utility functions for thread indexing in CUDA

## Notes
- indexing threads globally
- the many grid/block dimensions
- [".cuh" for CUDA header files](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2393855/3503855)

## Attribution
The code presented in this repo is just a wrapping over the one published in the blog post ["CUDA Thread Indexing Cheatsheet"](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/374/CUDA/CUDA-Thread-Indexing-Cheatsheet.pdf).

## TODOs
- add a section demonstrating the usage of `"tidx.cuh"`
- document the different utility methods using [doxygen conventions](https://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/docblocks.html)
- translate this README.md to french
